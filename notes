# notes
## html figures
- the initial state is in the html
- at least they have the syntax highlighting classes right
- it really is just a big-ass table
- well, the "editor" is. it's also got the three tabs beneath it
- to confirm: the editor is just a table, with text in cells
  - the cells have css classes like "keyword", "comment" and "command"
- i'm assuming right now that they construct this monstrosity, and then go back
  and interpret it.

- beneath table, two buttons linked to "runButton" and "walkButton"
- these wonderful "tabset" and "tab" tags

> go look and see if "col-lg-offset-1" is valid (pretty sure it's not)

- in figure tab
  - `ng-repeat='mem in varMemory'`
  - `ng-repeat='reg in varRegister'`

> the main area/table shouldn't be called the editor. it's closer to a
> 'textarea'. there's also an "editor" tab, with commands for manipulating the
> textarea

- in editor tab
  - `onclick='insertWord()'`
  - etc.

- in architecture tab
  - `ng-repeat='mem in memory'`
    - `{{mem.memno}}, {{mem.con*}}`
  - `ng-repeat='reg in register'`
    - `{{reg.content}}, {{reg.value}}`

- and then a list of javascript files
  - doesn't include figure.js

okay. so what needs to happen if i want to translate all this to MVC? we need
to be able to hold everything in javascript, and display it in html, with the
two being almost completely uncoupled.
